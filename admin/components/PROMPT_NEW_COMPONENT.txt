We are going to create a component component_name in folder /admin/components/component_name

database table names component_name_*

This is an advanced component that will interface with the other components that are located in /admin/components/ and needs to be highly configurable.

Make suggestions, recommendations and ask questions so we can get this as advanced and customisable as possible.
