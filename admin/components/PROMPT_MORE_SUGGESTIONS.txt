do you have anymore questions or suggestions to further improve it?
add more detail to each option so I can make better decision I prefer more advanced options giving more flexibility (best versatility).
ask question in a popup and mark which letter you recommend.
when adding the stars "GOOD=1", "BETTER=2", "BEST=3" add them to the beginning of the row
display the best choice as option A and then down in rank.
make all options selectable.
